### 1. Environments of UAE PASS

UAE PASS has two environments, one is "staging" for deployment testing, one is "production" for the production uses, configure it in `config/config.yaml` by setting the value for key `env`. 

And you can change the endpoints if the endpoints was updated by UAE PASS.

```shell
env : staging # staging or production, environment of "UAE PASS"

redis:
  address: localhost:6379
  password: 123456

# endpoints of "UAE Pass"
endpoints:
  staging:
    client_id: sandbox_stage
    credentials: c2FuZGJveF9zdGFnZTpzYW5kYm94X3N0YWdl
    authorization: https://stg-id.uaepass.ae/idshub/authorize
    token: https://stg-id.uaepass.ae/idshub/token
    user_info: https://stg-id.uaepass.ae/idshub/userinfo
    logout: https://stg-id.uaepass.ae/idshub/logout
  production:
    client_id:
    credentials:
    authorization: https://id.uaepass.ae/idshub/authorize
    token: https://id.uaepass.ae/idshub/token
    user_info: https://id.uaepass.ae/idshub/userinfo
    logout: https://id.uaepass.ae/idshub/logout
```
